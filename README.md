First I created database and tables in postgresql with the help of pgadmin.
Then in python i import psycopg2 package to provide connection with database.
I connect database and insert values in table with the help of python.
The issue i faced is connect table with each other and also not able to print list value  which are in dictionary in table for one column.
I created unittest cases for function in unit.py file.
